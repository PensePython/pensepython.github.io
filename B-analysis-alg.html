<h1>Analysis of Algorithms<a class="headerlink" href="#analysis-of-algorithms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<div>This appendix is an edited excerpt from <em>Think Complexity</em>, by Allen
B. Downey, also published by O’Reilly Media (2012). When you are
done with this book, you might want to move on to that one.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Analysis of algorithms</strong> is a branch of computer science that studies
the performance of algorithms, especially their run time and space
requirements. See <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms</a>.</p>
<p>The practical goal of algorithm analysis is to predict the performance
of different algorithms in order to guide design decisions.</p>
<p>During the 2008 United States Presidential Campaign, candidate Barack
Obama was asked to perform an impromptu analysis when he visited Google.
Chief executive Eric Schmidt jokingly asked him for “the most efficient
way to sort a million 32-bit integers.” Obama had apparently been tipped
off, because he quickly replied, “I think the bubble sort would be the
wrong way to go.” See <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4RRi_ntQc8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4RRi_ntQc8</a>.</p>
<p>This is true: bubble sort is conceptually simple but slow for large
datasets. The answer Schmidt was probably looking for is “radix sort”
(<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort</a>) <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id1">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of algorithm analysis is to make meaningful comparisons between
algorithms, but there are some problems:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The relative performance of the algorithms might depend on
characteristics of the hardware, so one algorithm might be faster on
Machine A, another on Machine B. The general solution to this problem
is to specify a <strong>machine model</strong> and analyze the number of steps, or
operations, an algorithm requires under a given model.</li>
<li>Relative performance might depend on the details of the dataset. For
example, some sorting algorithms run faster if the data are already
partially sorted; other algorithms run slower in this case. A common
way to avoid this problem is to analyze the <strong>worst case</strong> scenario.
It is sometimes useful to analyze average case performance, but
that’s usually harder, and it might not be obvious what set of cases
to average over.</li>
<li>Relative performance also depends on the size of the problem. A
sorting algorithm that is fast for small lists might be slow for long
lists. The usual solution to this problem is to express run time (or
number of operations) as a function of problem size, and group
functions into categories depending on how quickly they grow as
problem size increases.</li>
</ul>
<p>The good thing about this kind of comparison is that it lends itself to
simple classification of algorithms. For example, if I know that the run
time of Algorithm A tends to be proportional to the size of the input,
<span class="math">n</span>, and Algorithm B tends to be proportional to <span class="math">n^2</span>, then
I expect A to be faster than B, at least for large values of <span class="math">n</span>.</p>
<p>This kind of analysis comes with some caveats, but we’ll get to that
later.</p>
<div class="section" id="order-of-growth">
<h2>Order of growth<a class="headerlink" href="#order-of-growth" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Suppose you have analyzed two algorithms and expressed their run times
in terms of the size of the input: Algorithm A takes <span class="math">100n+1</span>
steps to solve a problem with size <span class="math">n</span>; Algorithm B takes
<span class="math">n^2 + n + 1</span> steps.</p>
<p>The following table shows the run time of these algorithms for different
problem sizes:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="22%" />
<col width="33%" />
<col width="46%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Input</td>
<td>Run time of</td>
<td>Run time of</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>size</td>
<td>Algorithm A</td>
<td>Algorithm B</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>10</td>
<td>1 001</td>
<td>111</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>100</td>
<td>10 001</td>
<td>10 101</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>1 000</td>
<td>100 001</td>
<td>1 001 001</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>10 000</td>
<td>1 000 001</td>
<td><span class="math">&gt; 10^{10}</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>At <span class="math">n=10</span>, Algorithm A looks pretty bad; it takes almost 10 times
longer than Algorithm B. But for <span class="math">n=100</span> they are about the same,
and for larger values A is much better.</p>
<p>The fundamental reason is that for large values of <span class="math">n</span>, any
function that contains an <span class="math">n^2</span> term will grow faster than a
function whose leading term is <span class="math">n</span>. The <strong>leading term</strong> is the
term with the highest exponent.</p>
<p>For Algorithm A, the leading term has a large coefficient, 100, which is
why B does better than A for small <span class="math">n</span>. But regardless of the
coefficients, there will always be some value of <span class="math">n</span> where
<span class="math">a n^2 &gt; b n</span>, for any values of <span class="math">a</span> and <span class="math">b</span>.</p>
<p>The same argument applies to the non-leading terms. Even if the run time
of Algorithm A were <span class="math">n+1000000</span>, it would still be better than
Algorithm B for sufficiently large <span class="math">n</span>.</p>
<p>In general, we expect an algorithm with a smaller leading term to be a
better algorithm for large problems, but for smaller problems, there may
be a <strong>crossover point</strong> where another algorithm is better. The location
of the crossover point depends on the details of the algorithms, the
inputs, and the hardware, so it is usually ignored for purposes of
algorithmic analysis. But that doesn’t mean you can forget about it.</p>
<p>If two algorithms have the same leading order term, it is hard to say
which is better; again, the answer depends on the details. So for
algorithmic analysis, functions with the same leading term are
considered equivalent, even if they have different coefficients.</p>
<p>An <strong>order of growth</strong> is a set of functions whose growth behavior is
considered equivalent. For example, <span class="math">2n</span>, <span class="math">100n</span> and
<span class="math">n+1</span> belong to the same order of growth, which is written
<span class="math">O(n)</span> in <strong>Big-Oh notation</strong> and often called <strong>linear</strong> because
every function in the set grows linearly with <span class="math">n</span>.</p>
<p>All functions with the leading term <span class="math">n^2</span> belong to
<span class="math">O(n^2)</span>; they are called <strong>quadratic</strong>.</p>
<p>The following table shows some of the orders of growth that appear most
commonly in algorithmic analysis, in increasing order of badness.</p>

<p>For the logarithmic terms, the base of the logarithm doesn’t matter;
changing bases is the equivalent of multiplying by a constant, which
doesn’t change the order of growth. Similarly, all exponential functions
belong to the same order of growth regardless of the base of the
exponent. Exponential functions grow very quickly, so exponential
algorithms are only useful for small problems.</p>
<p>Read the Wikipedia page on Big-Oh notation at
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation</a> and answer the following
questions:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>What is the order of growth of <span class="math">n^3 + n^2</span>? What about
<span class="math">1000000 n^3 + n^2</span>? What about <span class="math">n^3 + 1000000 n^2</span>?</li>
<li>What is the order of growth of <span class="math">(n^2 + n) \cdot (n + 1)</span>?
Before you start multiplying, remember that you only need the leading
term.</li>
<li>If <span class="math">f</span> is in <span class="math">O(g)</span>, for some unspecified function
<span class="math">g</span>, what can we say about <span class="math">af+b</span>?</li>
<li>If <span class="math">f_1</span> and <span class="math">f_2</span> are in <span class="math">O(g)</span>, what can we say
about <span class="math">f_1 + f_2</span>?</li>
<li>If <span class="math">f_1</span> is in <span class="math">O(g)</span> and <span class="math">f_2</span> is in <span class="math">O(h)</span>,
what can we say about <span class="math">f_1 + f_2</span>?</li>
<li>If <span class="math">f_1</span> is in <span class="math">O(g)</span> and <span class="math">f_2</span> is <span class="math">O(h)</span>,
what can we say about <span class="math">f_1 \cdot f_2</span>?</li>
</ol>
<p>Programmers who care about performance often find this kind of analysis
hard to swallow. They have a point: sometimes the coefficients and the
non-leading terms make a real difference. Sometimes the details of the
hardware, the programming language, and the characteristics of the input
make a big difference. And for small problems asymptotic behavior is
irrelevant.</p>
<p>But if you keep those caveats in mind, algorithmic analysis is a useful
tool. At least for large problems, the “better” algorithms is usually
better, and sometimes it is <em>much</em> better. The difference between two
algorithms with the same order of growth is usually a constant factor,
but the difference between a good algorithm and a bad algorithm is
unbounded!</p>

<h2>Analysis of basic Python operations<a class="headerlink" href="#analysis-of-basic-python-operations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In Python, most arithmetic operations are constant time; multiplication
usually takes longer than addition and subtraction, and division takes
even longer, but these run times don’t depend on the magnitude of the
operands. Very large integers are an exception; in that case the run
time increases with the number of digits.</p>
<p>Indexing operations—reading or writing elements in a sequence or
dictionary—are also constant time, regardless of the size of the data
structure.</p>
<p>A for loop that traverses a sequence or dictionary is usually linear, as
long as all of the operations in the body of the loop are constant time.
For example, adding up the elements of a list is linear:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">t</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The built-in function sum is also linear because it does the same thing,
but it tends to be faster because it is a more efficient implementation;
in the language of algorithmic analysis, it has a smaller leading
coefficient.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, if the body of a loop is in <span class="math">O(n^a)</span> then the
whole loop is in <span class="math">O(n^{a+1})</span>. The exception is if you can show
that the loop exits after a constant number of iterations. If a loop
runs <span class="math">k</span> times regardless of <span class="math">n</span>, then the loop is in
<span class="math">O(n^a)</span>, even for large <span class="math">k</span>.</p>
<p>Multiplying by <span class="math">k</span> doesn’t change the order of growth, but neither
does dividing. So if the body of a loop is in <span class="math">O(n^a)</span> and it runs
<span class="math">n/k</span> times, the loop is in <span class="math">O(n^{a+1})</span>, even for large
<span class="math">k</span>.</p>
<p>Most string and tuple operations are linear, except indexing and len,
which are constant time. The built-in functions min and max are linear.
The run-time of a slice operation is proportional to the length of the
output, but independent of the size of the input.</p>
<p>String concatenation is linear; the run time depends on the sum of the
lengths of the operands.</p>
<p>All string methods are linear, but if the lengths of the strings are
bounded by a constant—for example, operations on single characters—they
are considered constant time. The string method join is linear; the run
time depends on the total length of the strings.</p>
<p>Most list methods are linear, but there are some exceptions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Adding an element to the end of a list is constant time on average;
when it runs out of room it occasionally gets copied to a bigger
location, but the total time for <span class="math">n</span> operations is
<span class="math">O(n)</span>, so the average time for each operation is <span class="math">O(1)</span>.</li>
<li>Removing an element from the end of a list is constant time.</li>
<li>Sorting is <span class="math">O(n \log n)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most dictionary operations and methods are constant time, but there are
some exceptions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The run time of update is proportional to the size of the dictionary
passed as a parameter, not the dictionary being updated.</li>
<li>keys, values and items are constant time because they return
iterators. But if you loop through the iterators, the loop will be
linear.</li>
</ul>
<p>The performance of dictionaries is one of the minor miracles of computer
science. We will see how they work in Section&nbsp;[hashtable].</p>
<p>Read the Wikipedia page on sorting algorithms at

<div class="section" id="analysis-of-search-algorithms">
<h2>Analysis of search algorithms<a class="headerlink" href="#analysis-of-search-algorithms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A <strong>search</strong> is an algorithm that takes a collection and a target item
and determines whether the target is in the collection, often returning
the index of the target.</p>
<p>The simplest search algorithm is a “linear search”, which traverses the
items of the collection in order, stopping if it finds the target. In
the worst case it has to traverse the entire collection, so the run time
is linear.</p>
<p>The in operator for sequences uses a linear search; so do string methods
like find and count.</p>
<p>If the elements of the sequence are in order, you can use a <strong>bisection
search</strong>, which is <span class="math">O(\log n)</span>. Bisection search is similar to the
algorithm you might use to look a word up in a dictionary (a paper
dictionary, not the data structure). Instead of starting at the
beginning and checking each item in order, you start with the item in
the middle and check whether the word you are looking for comes before
or after. If it comes before, then you search the first half of the
sequence. Otherwise you search the second half. Either way, you cut the
number of remaining items in half.</p>
<p>If the sequence has 1,000,000 items, it will take about 20 steps to find
the word or conclude that it’s not there. So that’s about 50,000 times
faster than a linear search.</p>
<p>Bisection search can be much faster than linear search, but it requires
the sequence to be in order, which might require extra work.</p>
<p>There is another data structure, called a <strong>hashtable</strong> that is even
faster—it can do a search in constant time—and it doesn’t require the
items to be sorted. Python dictionaries are implemented using
hashtables, which is why most dictionary operations, including the in
operator, are constant time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hashtables">
<h2>Hashtables<a class="headerlink" href="#hashtables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To explain how hashtables work and why their performance is so good, I
start with a simple implementation of a map and gradually improve it
until it’s a hashtable.</p>
<p>I use Python to demonstrate these implementations, but in real life you
wouldn’t write code like this in Python; you would just use a
dictionary! So for the rest of this chapter, you have to imagine that
dictionaries don’t exist and you want to implement a data structure that
maps from keys to values. The operations you have to implement are:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>add(k, v):</dt>
<dd>Add a new item that maps from key k to value v. With a Python
dictionary, d, this operation is written d[k] = v.</dd>
<dt>get(k):</dt>
<dd>Look up and return the value that corresponds to key k. With a
Python dictionary, d, this operation is written d[k] or d.get(k).</dd>
</dl>
<p>For now, I assume that each key only appears once. The simplest
implementation of this interface uses a list of tuples, where each tuple
is a key-value pair.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">LinearMap</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>add appends a key-value tuple to the list of items, which takes constant
time.</p>
<p>get uses a for loop to search the list: if it finds the target key it
returns the corresponding value; otherwise it raises a KeyError. So get
is linear.</p>
<p>An alternative is to keep the list sorted by key. Then get could use a
bisection search, which is <span class="math">O(\log n)</span>. But inserting a new item
in the middle of a list is linear, so this might not be the best option.
There are other data structures that can implement add and get in log
time, but that’s still not as good as constant time, so let’s move on.</p>
<p>One way to improve LinearMap is to break the list of key-value pairs
into smaller lists. Here’s an implementation called BetterMap, which is
a list of 100 LinearMaps. As we’ll see in a second, the order of growth
for get is still linear, but BetterMap is a step on the path toward
hashtables:</p>

<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__init__</span></code> makes a list of n LinearMaps.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">find_map</span></code> is used by add and get to figure out which map to put the
new item in, or which map to search.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">find_map</span></code> uses the built-in function hash, which takes almost any
Python object and returns an integer. A limitation of this
implementation is that it only works with hashable keys. Mutable types
like lists and dictionaries are unhashable.</p>
<p>Hashable objects that are considered equivalent return the same hash
value, but the converse is not necessarily true: two objects with
different values can return the same hash value.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">find_map</span></code> uses the modulus operator to wrap the hash values into the
range from 0 to len(self.maps), so the result is a legal index into the
list. Of course, this means that many different hash values will wrap
onto the same index. But if the hash function spreads things out pretty
evenly (which is what hash functions are designed to do), then we expect
<span class="math">n/100</span> items per LinearMap.</p>
<p>Since the run time of LinearMap.get is proportional to the number of
items, we expect BetterMap to be about 100 times faster than LinearMap.
The order of growth is still linear, but the leading coefficient is
smaller. That’s nice, but still not as good as a hashtable.</p>
<p>Here (finally) is the crucial idea that makes hashtables fast: if you
can keep the maximum length of the LinearMaps bounded, LinearMap.get is
constant time. All you have to do is keep track of the number of items
and when the number of items per LinearMap exceeds a threshold, resize
the hashtable by adding more LinearMaps.</p>
<p>Here is an implementation of a hashtable:</p>

<p>Each HashMap contains a BetterMap; <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__init__</span></code> starts with just 2
LinearMaps and initializes num, which keeps track of the number of
items.</p>
<p>get just dispatches to BetterMap. The real work happens in add, which
checks the number of items and the size of the BetterMap: if they are
equal, the average number of items per LinearMap is 1, so it calls
resize.</p>
<p>resize make a new BetterMap, twice as big as the previous one, and then
“rehashes” the items from the old map to the new.</p>
<p>Rehashing is necessary because changing the number of LinearMaps changes
the denominator of the modulus operator in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">find_map</span></code>. That means that
some objects that used to hash into the same LinearMap will get split up
(which is what we wanted, right?).</p>
<p>Rehashing is linear, so resize is linear, which might seem bad, since I
promised that add would be constant time. But remember that we don’t
have to resize every time, so add is usually constant time and only
occasionally linear. The total amount of work to run add <span class="math">n</span> times
is proportional to <span class="math">n</span>, so the average time of each add is
constant time!</p>
<p>To see how this works, think about starting with an empty HashTable and
adding a sequence of items. We start with 2 LinearMaps, so the first 2
adds are fast (no resizing required). Let’s say that they take one unit
of work each. The next add requires a resize, so we have to rehash the
first two items (let’s call that 2 more units of work) and then add the
third item (one more unit). Adding the next item costs 1 unit, so the
total so far is 6 units of work for 4 items.</p>
<p>The next add costs 5 units, but the next three are only one unit each,
so the total is 14 units for the first 8 adds.</p>
<p>The next add costs 9 units, but then we can add 7 more before the next
resize, so the total is 30 units for the first 16 adds.</p>
<p>After 32 adds, the total cost is 62 units, and I hope you are starting
to see a pattern. After <span class="math">n</span> adds, where <span class="math">n</span> is a power of
two, the total cost is <span class="math">2n-2</span> units, so the average work per add
is a little less than 2 units. When <span class="math">n</span> is a power of two, that’s
the best case; for other values of <span class="math">n</span> the average work is a
little higher, but that’s not important. The important thing is that it
is <span class="math">O(1)</span>.</p>
<p>Figure&nbsp;[fig.hash] shows how this works graphically. Each block
represents a unit of work. The columns show the total work for each add
in order from left to right: the first two adds cost 1 units, the third
costs 3 units, etc.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id4">
<img alt="The cost of a hashtable add.[fig.hash]" src="_images/towers.pdf" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The cost of a hashtable add.[fig.hash]</span></p>
</div>
<p>The extra work of rehashing appears as a sequence of increasingly tall
towers with increasing space between them. Now if you knock over the
towers, spreading the cost of resizing over all adds, you can see
graphically that the total cost after <span class="math">n</span> adds is <span class="math">2n - 2</span>.</p>
<p>An important feature of this algorithm is that when we resize the
HashTable it grows geometrically; that is, we multiply the size by a
constant. If you increase the size arithmetically—adding a fixed number
each time—the average time per add is linear.</p>
<p>You can download my implementation of HashMap from
<a class="reference external" href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/Map.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/Map.py</a>, but remember that there is no
reason to use it; if you want a map, just use a Python dictionary.</p>
