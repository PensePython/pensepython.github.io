análise de algoritmos (*analysis of algorithms*)
  A way to compare algorithms in terms of their run time and/or space requirements.

máquina-modelo (*machine model*)
  A simplified representation of a computer used to describe algorithms.

pior caso (*worst case*)
  The input that makes a given algorithm run slowest (or require the most space.

termo dominante (*leading term*)
  In a polynomial, the term with the highest exponent.

ponto de cruzamento (*crossover point*)
  The problem size where two algorithms require the same run time or space.

ordem de crescimento (*order of growth*)
  A set of functions that all grow in a way considered equivalent for purposes of analysis of algorithms. For example, all functions that grow linearly belong to the same order of growth.

notação assintótica (*Big-Oh notation*)
  Notation for representing an order of growth; for example, :math:`O(n)` represents the set of functions that grow linearly.

*linear* (linear)
  An algorithm whose run time is proportional to problem size, at least for large problem sizes.

quadrático (*quadratic*)
  An algorithm whose run time is proportional to :math:`n^2`, where :math:`n` is a measure of problem size.

busca (*search*)
  The problem of locating an element of a collection (like a list or dictionary) or determining that it is not present.

tabela de hash (*hashtable*)
  A data structure that represents a collection of key-value pairs and performs search in constant time.
