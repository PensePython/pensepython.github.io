<h1>Inheritance<a class="headerlink" href="#inheritance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The language feature most often associated with object-oriented
programming is <strong>inheritance</strong>. Inheritance is the ability to define a
new class that is a modified version of an existing class. In this
chapter I demonstrate inheritance using classes that represent playing
cards, decks of cards, and poker hands.</p>
<p>If you don’t play poker, you can read about it at
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker</a>, but you don’t have to; I’ll tell you
what you need to know for the exercises.</p>
<p>Code examples from this chapter are available from
<a class="reference external" href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/Card.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/Card.py</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="card-objects">
<h2>Card objects<a class="headerlink" href="#card-objects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are fifty-two cards in a deck, each of which belongs to one of
four suits and one of thirteen ranks. The suits are Spades, Hearts,
Diamonds, and Clubs (in descending order in bridge). The ranks are Ace,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, and King. Depending on the game
that you are playing, an Ace may be higher than King or lower than 2.</p>
<p>If we want to define a new object to represent a playing card, it is
obvious what the attributes should be: rank and suit. It is not as
obvious what type the attributes should be. One possibility is to use
strings containing words like <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">'Spade'</span></code> for suits and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">'Queen'</span></code> for
ranks. One problem with this implementation is that it would not be easy
to compare cards to see which had a higher rank or suit.</p>
<p>An alternative is to use integers to <strong>encode</strong> the ranks and suits. In
this context, “encode” means that we are going to define a mapping
between numbers and suits, or between numbers and ranks. This kind of
encoding is not meant to be a secret (that would be “encryption”).</p>
<p>For example, this table shows the suits and the corresponding integer
codes:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="33%" />
<col width="53%" />
<col width="14%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Spades</td>
<td><span class="math">\mapsto</span></td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Hearts</td>
<td><span class="math">\mapsto</span></td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Diamonds</td>
<td><span class="math">\mapsto</span></td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Clubs</td>
<td><span class="math">\mapsto</span></td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This code makes it easy to compare cards; because higher suits map to
higher numbers, we can compare suits by comparing their codes.</p>
<p>The mapping for ranks is fairly obvious; each of the numerical ranks
maps to the corresponding integer, and for face cards:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="26%" />
<col width="56%" />
<col width="18%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Jack</td>
<td><span class="math">\mapsto</span></td>
<td>11</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Queen</td>
<td><span class="math">\mapsto</span></td>
<td>12</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>King</td>
<td><span class="math">\mapsto</span></td>
<td>13</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I am using the <span class="math">\mapsto</span>&nbsp;symbol to make it clear that these
mappings are not part of the Python program. They are part of the
program design, but they don’t appear explicitly in the code.</p>
<p>The class definition for Card looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Card</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Represents a standard playing card.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">suit</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">rank</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">suit</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">suit</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rank</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">rank</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As usual, the init method takes an optional parameter for each
attribute. The default card is the 2 of Clubs.</p>
<p>To create a Card, you call Card with the suit and rank of the card you
want.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">queen_of_diamonds</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Card</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="class-attributes">
<h2>Class attributes<a class="headerlink" href="#class-attributes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order to print Card objects in a way that people can easily read, we
need a mapping from the integer codes to the corresponding ranks and
suits. A natural way to do that is with lists of strings. We assign
these lists to <strong>class attributes</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre># inside class Card:

    suit_names = [&#39;Clubs&#39;, &#39;Diamonds&#39;, &#39;Hearts&#39;, &#39;Spades&#39;]
    rank_names = [None, &#39;Ace&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;4&#39;, &#39;5&#39;, &#39;6&#39;, &#39;7&#39;,
              &#39;8&#39;, &#39;9&#39;, &#39;10&#39;, &#39;Jack&#39;, &#39;Queen&#39;, &#39;King&#39;]

    def __str__(self):
        return &#39;%s of %s&#39; % (Card.rank_names[self.rank],
                             Card.suit_names[self.suit])
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Variables like <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">suit_names</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rank_names</span></code>, which are defined
inside a class but outside of any method, are called class attributes
because they are associated with the class object Card.</p>
<p>This term distinguishes them from variables like suit and rank, which
are called <strong>instance attributes</strong> because they are associated with a
particular instance.</p>
<p>Both kinds of attribute are accessed using dot notation. For example, in
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__str__</span></code>, self is a Card object, and self.rank is its rank.
Similarly, Card is a class object, and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Card.rank_names</span></code> is a list of
strings associated with the class.</p>
<p>Every card has its own suit and rank, but there is only one copy of
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">suit_names</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rank_names</span></code>.</p>
<p>Putting it all together, the expression <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Card.rank_names[self.rank]</span></code>
means “use the attribute rank from the object self as an index into the
list <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rank_names</span></code> from the class Card, and select the appropriate
string.”</p>
<p>The first element of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rank_names</span></code> is None because there is no card
with rank zero. By including None as a place-keeper, we get a mapping
with the nice property that the index 2 maps to the string <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">'2'</span></code>, and
so on. To avoid this tweak, we could have used a dictionary instead of a
list.</p>
<p>With the methods we have so far, we can create and print cards:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">card1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Card</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">card1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">Jack of Hearts</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="figure" id="id2">
<img alt="Object diagram." src="_images/card1.pdf" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Object diagram.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Figure&nbsp;[fig.card1] is a diagram of the Card class object and one Card
instance. Card is a class object; its type is type. card1 is an instance
of Card, so its type is Card. To save space, I didn’t draw the contents
of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">suit_names</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rank_names</span></code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="comparing-cards">
<h2>Comparing cards<a class="headerlink" href="#comparing-cards" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For built-in types, there are relational operators (&lt;, &gt;, ==, etc.) that
compare values and determine when one is greater than, less than, or
equal to another. For programmer-defined types, we can override the
behavior of the built-in operators by providing a method named
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__lt__</span></code>, which stands for “less than”.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__lt__</span></code> takes two parameters, self and other, and True if self is
strictly less than other.</p>
<p>The correct ordering for cards is not obvious. For example, which is
better, the 3 of Clubs or the 2 of Diamonds? One has a higher rank, but
the other has a higher suit. In order to compare cards, you have to
decide whether rank or suit is more important.</p>
<p>The answer might depend on what game you are playing, but to keep things
simple, we’ll make the arbitrary choice that suit is more important, so
all of the Spades outrank all of the Diamonds, and so on.</p>
<p>With that decided, we can write <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__lt__</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre># inside class Card:

    def __lt__(self, other):
        # check the suits
        if self.suit &lt; other.suit: return True
        if self.suit &gt; other.suit: return False

        # suits are the same... check ranks
        return self.rank &lt; other.rank
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can write this more concisely using tuple comparison:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre># inside class Card:

    def __lt__(self, other):
        t1 = self.suit, self.rank
        t2 = other.suit, other.rank
        return t1 &lt; t2
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As an exercise, write an <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__lt__</span></code> method for Time objects. You can use
tuple comparison, but you also might consider comparing integers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="decks">
<h2>Decks<a class="headerlink" href="#decks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now that we have Cards, the next step is to define Decks. Since a deck
is made up of cards, it is natural for each Deck to contain a list of
cards as an attribute.</p>
<p>The following is a class definition for Deck. The init method creates
the attribute cards and generates the standard set of fifty-two cards:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Deck</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cards</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
        <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">suit</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">):</span>
            <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">rank</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">14</span><span class="p">):</span>
                <span class="n">card</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Card</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">suit</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">rank</span><span class="p">)</span>
                <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cards</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">card</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The easiest way to populate the deck is with a nested loop. The outer
loop enumerates the suits from 0 to 3. The inner loop enumerates the
ranks from 1 to 13. Each iteration creates a new Card with the current
suit and rank, and appends it to self.cards.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="printing-the-deck">
<h2>Printing the deck<a class="headerlink" href="#printing-the-deck" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Here is a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__str__</span></code> method for Deck:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>#inside class Deck:

    def __str__(self):
        res = []
        for card in self.cards:
            res.append(str(card))
        return &#39;\n&#39;.join(res)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This method demonstrates an efficient way to accumulate a large string:
building a list of strings and then using the string method join. The
built-in function str invokes the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__str__</span></code> method on each card and
returns the string representation.</p>
<p>Since we invoke join on a newline character, the cards are separated by
newlines. Here’s what the result looks like:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">deck</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Deck</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">deck</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">Ace of Clubs</span>
<span class="go">2 of Clubs</span>
<span class="go">3 of Clubs</span>
<span class="gp">...</span>
<span class="go">10 of Spades</span>
<span class="go">Jack of Spades</span>
<span class="go">Queen of Spades</span>
<span class="go">King of Spades</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Even though the result appears on 52 lines, it is one long string that
contains newlines.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="add-remove-shuffle-and-sort">
<h2>Add, remove, shuffle and sort<a class="headerlink" href="#add-remove-shuffle-and-sort" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To deal cards, we would like a method that removes a card from the deck
and returns it. The list method pop provides a convenient way to do
that:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>#inside class Deck:

    def pop_card(self):
        return self.cards.pop()
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Since pop removes the <em>last</em> card in the list, we are dealing from the
bottom of the deck.</p>
<p>To add a card, we can use the list method append:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>#inside class Deck:

    def add_card(self, card):
        self.cards.append(card)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A method like this that uses another method without doing much work is
sometimes called a <strong>veneer</strong>. The metaphor comes from woodworking,
where a veneer is a thin layer of good quality wood glued to the surface
of a cheaper piece of wood to improve the appearance.</p>
<p>In this case <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">add_card</span></code> is a “thin” method that expresses a list
operation in terms appropriate for decks. It improves the appearance, or
interface, of the implementation.</p>
<p>As another example, we can write a Deck method named shuffle using the
function shuffle from the random module:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre># inside class Deck:

    def shuffle(self):
        random.shuffle(self.cards)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Don’t forget to import random.</p>
<p>As an exercise, write a Deck method named sort that uses the list method
sort to sort the cards in a Deck. sort uses the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__lt__</span></code> method we
defined to determine the order.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h2>Inheritance<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Inheritance is the ability to define a new class that is a modified
version of an existing class. As an example, let’s say we want a class
to represent a “hand”, that is, the cards held by one player. A hand is
similar to a deck: both are made up of a collection of cards, and both
require operations like adding and removing cards.</p>
<p>A hand is also different from a deck; there are operations we want for
hands that don’t make sense for a deck. For example, in poker we might
compare two hands to see which one wins. In bridge, we might compute a
score for a hand in order to make a bid.</p>
<p>This relationship between classes—similar, but different—lends itself to
inheritance. To define a new class that inherits from an existing class,
you put the name of the existing class in parentheses:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Hand</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Deck</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Represents a hand of playing cards.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This definition indicates that Hand inherits from Deck; that means we
can use methods like <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pop_card</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">add_card</span></code> for Hands as well as
Decks.</p>
<p>When a new class inherits from an existing one, the existing one is
called the <strong>parent</strong> and the new class is called the <strong>child</strong>.</p>
<p>In this example, Hand inherits <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__init__</span></code> from Deck, but it doesn’t
really do what we want: instead of populating the hand with 52 new
cards, the init method for Hands should initialize cards with an empty
list.</p>
<p>If we provide an init method in the Hand class, it overrides the one in
the Deck class:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre># inside class Hand:

    def __init__(self, label=&#39;&#39;):
        self.cards = []
        self.label = label
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When you create a Hand, Python invokes this init method, not the one in
Deck.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">hand</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Hand</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;new hand&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">hand</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cards</span>
<span class="go">[]</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">hand</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">label</span>
<span class="go">&#39;new hand&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The other methods are inherited from Deck, so we can use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pop_card</span></code>
and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">add_card</span></code> to deal a card:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">deck</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Deck</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">card</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">deck</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pop_card</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">hand</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">add_card</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">card</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">hand</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">King of Spades</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A natural next step is to encapsulate this code in a method called
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">move_cards</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>#inside class Deck:

    def move_cards(self, hand, num):
        for i in range(num):
            hand.add_card(self.pop_card())
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">move_cards</span></code> takes two arguments, a Hand object and the number of
cards to deal. It modifies both self and hand, and returns None.</p>
<p>In some games, cards are moved from one hand to another, or from a hand
back to the deck. You can use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">move_cards</span></code> for any of these
operations: self can be either a Deck or a Hand, and hand, despite the
name, can also be a Deck.</p>
<p>Inheritance is a useful feature. Some programs that would be repetitive
without inheritance can be written more elegantly with it. Inheritance
can facilitate code reuse, since you can customize the behavior of
parent classes without having to modify them. In some cases, the
inheritance structure reflects the natural structure of the problem,
which makes the design easier to understand.</p>
<p>On the other hand, inheritance can make programs difficult to read. When
a method is invoked, it is sometimes not clear where to find its
definition. The relevant code may be spread across several modules.
Also, many of the things that can be done using inheritance can be done
as well or better without it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="class-diagrams">
<h2>Class diagrams<a class="headerlink" href="#class-diagrams" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>So far we have seen stack diagrams, which show the state of a program,
and object diagrams, which show the attributes of an object and their
values. These diagrams represent a snapshot in the execution of a
program, so they change as the program runs.</p>
<p>They are also highly detailed; for some purposes, too detailed. A class
diagram is a more abstract representation of the structure of a program.
Instead of showing individual objects, it shows classes and the
relationships between them.</p>
<p>There are several kinds of relationship between classes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Objects in one class might contain references to objects in another
class. For example, each Rectangle contains a reference to a Point,
and each Deck contains references to many Cards. This kind of
relationship is called <strong>HAS-A</strong>, as in, “a Rectangle has a Point.”</li>
<li>One class might inherit from another. This relationship is called
<strong>IS-A</strong>, as in, “a Hand is a kind of a Deck.”</li>
<li>One class might depend on another in the sense that objects in one
class take objects in the second class as parameters, or use objects
in the second class as part of a computation. This kind of
relationship is called a <strong>dependency</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>class diagram</strong> is a graphical representation of these
relationships. For example, Figure&nbsp;[fig.class1] shows the relationships
between Card, Deck and Hand.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id3">
<img alt="Class diagram." src="_images/class1.pdf" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Class diagram.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The arrow with a hollow triangle head represents an IS-A relationship;
in this case it indicates that Hand inherits from Deck.</p>
<p>The standard arrow head represents a HAS-A relationship; in this case a
Deck has references to Card objects.</p>
<p>The star () near the arrow head is a <strong>multiplicity</strong>; it indicates how
many Cards a Deck has. A multiplicity can be a simple number, like 52, a
range, like 5..7 or a star, which indicates that a Deck can have any
number of Cards.</p>
<p>There are no dependencies in this diagram. They would normally be shown
with a dashed arrow. Or if there are a lot of dependencies, they are
sometimes omitted.</p>
<p>A more detailed diagram might show that a Deck actually contains a
<em>list</em> of Cards, but built-in types like list and dict are usually not
included in class diagrams.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="debugging">
<h2>Debugging<a class="headerlink" href="#debugging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Inheritance can make debugging difficult because when you invoke a
method on an object, it might be hard to figure out which method will be
invoked.</p>
<p>Suppose you are writing a function that works with Hand objects. You
would like it to work with all kinds of Hands, like PokerHands,
BridgeHands, etc. If you invoke a method like shuffle, you might get the
one defined in Deck, but if any of the subclasses override this method,
you’ll get that version instead. This behavior is usually a good thing,
but it can be confusing.</p>
<p>Any time you are unsure about the flow of execution through your
program, the simplest solution is to add print statements at the
beginning of the relevant methods. If Deck.shuffle prints a message that
says something like Running Deck.shuffle, then as the program runs it
traces the flow of execution.</p>
<p>As an alternative, you could use this function, which takes an object
and a method name (as a string) and returns the class that provides the
definition of the method:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">find_defining_class</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">obj</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">meth_name</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">ty</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">obj</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mro</span><span class="p">():</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">meth_name</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">ty</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__dict__</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">ty</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">hand</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Hand</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">find_defining_class</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">hand</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;shuffle&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">&lt;class &#39;Card.Deck&#39;&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>So the shuffle method for this Hand is the one in Deck.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">find_defining_class</span></code> uses the mro method to get the list of class
objects (types) that will be searched for methods. “MRO” stands for
“method resolution order”, which is the sequence of classes Python
searches to “resolve” a method name.</p>
<p>Here’s a design suggestion: when you override a method, the interface of
the new method should be the same as the old. It should take the same
parameters, return the same type, and obey the same preconditions and
postconditions. If you follow this rule, you will find that any function
designed to work with an instance of a parent class, like a Deck, will
also work with instances of child classes like a Hand and PokerHand.</p>
<p>If you violate this rule, which is called the “Liskov substitution
principle”, your code will collapse like (sorry) a house of cards.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-encapsulation">
<h2>Data encapsulation<a class="headerlink" href="#data-encapsulation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The previous chapters demonstrate a development plan we might call
“object-oriented design”. We identified objects we needed—like Point,
Rectangle and Time—and defined classes to represent them. In each case
there is an obvious correspondence between the object and some entity in
the real world (or at least a mathematical world).</p>
<p>But sometimes it is less obvious what objects you need and how they
should interact. In that case you need a different development plan. In
the same way that we discovered function interfaces by encapsulation and
generalization, we can discover class interfaces by <strong>data
encapsulation</strong>.</p>
<p>Markov analysis, from Section&nbsp;[markov], provides a good example. If you
download my code from <a class="reference external" href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/markov.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/markov.py</a>, you’ll see
that it uses two global variables—<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">suffix_map</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">prefix</span></code>—that
are read and written from several functions.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">suffix_map</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
<span class="n">prefix</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Because these variables are global, we can only run one analysis at a
time. If we read two texts, their prefixes and suffixes would be added
to the same data structures (which makes for some interesting generated
text).</p>
<p>To run multiple analyses, and keep them separate, we can encapsulate the
state of each analysis in an object. Here’s what that looks like:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Markov</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">suffix_map</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">prefix</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Next, we transform the functions into methods. For example, here’s
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">process_word</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">process_word</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">word</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">order</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">prefix</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">order</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">prefix</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">word</span><span class="p">,)</span>
        <span class="k">return</span>

    <span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">suffix_map</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">prefix</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">word</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">except</span> <span class="ne">KeyError</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="c"># if there is no entry for this prefix, make one</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">suffix_map</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">prefix</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">word</span><span class="p">]</span>

    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">prefix</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">shift</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">prefix</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">word</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Transforming a program like this—changing the design without changing
the behavior—is another example of refactoring (see
Section&nbsp;[refactoring]).</p>
<p>This example suggests a development plan for designing objects and
methods:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Start by writing functions that read and write global variables (when
necessary).</li>
<li>Once you get the program working, look for associations between
global variables and the functions that use them.</li>
<li>Encapsulate related variables as attributes of an object.</li>
<li>Transform the associated functions into methods of the new class.</li>
</ol>
<p>As an exercise, download my Markov code from
<a class="reference external" href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/markov.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/markov.py</a>, and follow the steps described
above to encapsulate the global variables as attributes of a new class
called Markov. Solution: <a class="reference external" href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/Markov.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/Markov.py</a> (note
