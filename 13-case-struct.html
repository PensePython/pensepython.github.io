<p>At this point you have learned about Python’s core data structures, and
you have seen some of the algorithms that use them. If you would like to
know more about algorithms, this might be a good time to read
Chapter&nbsp;[algorithms]. But you don’t have to read it before you go on;
you can read it whenever you are interested.</p>
<p>This chapter presents a case study with exercises that let you think
about choosing data structures and practice using them.</p>
<div class="section" id="word-frequency-analysis">
<h2>Word frequency analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#word-frequency-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As usual, you should at least attempt the exercises before you read my
solutions.</p>
<p>Write a program that reads a file, breaks each line into words, strips
whitespace and punctuation from the words, and converts them to
lowercase.</p>
<p>Hint: The string module provides a string named whitespace, which
contains space, tab, newline, etc., and punctuation which contains the
punctuation characters. Let’s see if we can make Python swear:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">string</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">string</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">punctuation</span>
<span class="go">&#39;!&quot;#$%&amp;&#39;()*+,-./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\]^_`{|}~&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Also, you might consider using the string methods strip, replace and
translate.</p>
<p>Go to Project Gutenberg (<a class="reference external" href="http://gutenberg.org">http://gutenberg.org</a>) and download your
favorite out-of-copyright book in plain text format.</p>
<p>Modify your program from the previous exercise to read the book you
downloaded, skip over the header information at the beginning of the
file, and process the rest of the words as before.</p>
<p>Then modify the program to count the total number of words in the book,
and the number of times each word is used.</p>
<p>Print the number of different words used in the book. Compare different
books by different authors, written in different eras. Which author uses
the most extensive vocabulary?</p>
<p>Modify the program from the previous exercise to print the 20 most
frequently used words in the book.</p>
<p>Modify the previous program to read a word list (see Section&nbsp;[wordlist])
and then print all the words in the book that are not in the word list.
How many of them are typos? How many of them are common words that
<em>should</em> be in the word list, and how many of them are really obscure?</p>

<div class="section" id="random-numbers">
<h2>Random numbers<a class="headerlink" href="#random-numbers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Given the same inputs, most computer programs generate the same outputs
every time, so they are said to be <strong>deterministic</strong>. Determinism is
usually a good thing, since we expect the same calculation to yield the
same result. For some applications, though, we want the computer to be
unpredictable. Games are an obvious example, but there are more.</p>
<p>Making a program truly nondeterministic turns out to be difficult, but
there are ways to make it at least seem nondeterministic. One of them is
to use algorithms that generate <strong>pseudorandom</strong> numbers. Pseudorandom
numbers are not truly random because they are generated by a
deterministic computation, but just by looking at the numbers it is all
but impossible to distinguish them from random.</p>
<p>The random module provides functions that generate pseudorandom numbers
(which I will simply call “random” from here on).</p>
<p>The function random returns a random float between 0.0 and 1.0
(including 0.0 but not 1.0). Each time you call random, you get the next
number in a long series. To see a sample, run this loop:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">random</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">random</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">random</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The function randint takes parameters low and high and returns an
integer between low and high (including both).</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">random</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">randint</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">5</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">random</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">randint</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">9</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To choose an element from a sequence at random, you can use choice:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">random</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">choice</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="go">3</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The random module also provides functions to generate random values from
continuous distributions including Gaussian, exponential, gamma, and a
few more.</p>
<p>Write a function named <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">choose_from_hist</span></code> that takes a histogram as
defined in Section&nbsp;[histogram] and returns a random value from the
histogram, chosen with probability in proportion to frequency. For
example, for this histogram:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">t</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;a&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;a&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;b&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">hist</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">histogram</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">hist</span>
<span class="go">{&#39;a&#39;: 2, &#39;b&#39;: 1}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>your function should return <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">'a'</span></code> with probability <span class="math">2/3</span> and
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">'b'</span></code> with probability <span class="math">1/3</span>.</p>

<p>This program reads emma.txt, which contains the text of <em>Emma</em> by Jane
Austen.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">process_file</span></code> loops through the lines of the file, passing them one
at a time to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">process_line</span></code>. The histogram hist is being used as an
accumulator.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">process_line</span></code> uses the string method replace to replace hyphens with
spaces before using split to break the line into a list of strings. It
traverses the list of words and uses strip and lower to remove
punctuation and convert to lower case. (It is a shorthand to say that
strings are “converted”; remember that strings are immutable, so methods
like strip and lower return new strings.)</p>
<p>Finally, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">process_line</span></code> updates the histogram by creating a new item
or incrementing an existing one.</p>
<p>To count the total number of words in the file, we can add up the

<p>The number of different words is just the number of items in the

<h2>Most common words<a class="headerlink" href="#most-common-words" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To find the most common words, we can make a list of tuples, where each
tuple contains a word and its frequency, and sort it.</p>
<p>The following function takes a histogram and returns a list of
word-frequency tuples:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">most_common</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">hist</span><span class="p">):</span>

</div>
<p>In each tuple, the frequency appears first, so the resulting list is
sorted by frequency. Here is a loop that prints the ten most common
words:</p>

<p>I use the keyword argument sep to tell print to use a tab character as a
“separator”, rather than a space, so the second column is lined up. Here
are the results from <em>Emma</em>:</p>

<h2>Optional parameters<a class="headerlink" href="#optional-parameters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We have seen built-in functions and methods that take optional
arguments. It is possible to write programmer-defined functions with
optional arguments, too. For example, here is a function that prints the
most common words in a histogram</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_most_common</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">hist</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">num</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">):</span>

<p>The first parameter is required; the second is optional. The <strong>default

<p>If you only provide one argument:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">print_most_common</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">hist</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>num gets the default value. If you provide two arguments:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">print_most_common</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">hist</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>num gets the value of the argument instead. In other words, the optional
argument <strong>overrides</strong> the default value.</p>
<p>If a function has both required and optional parameters, all the
required parameters have to come first, followed by the optional ones.</p>

<h2>Random words<a class="headerlink" href="#random-words" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To choose a random word from the histogram, the simplest algorithm is to
build a list with multiple copies of each word, according to the
observed frequency, and then choose from the list:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">random_word</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">h</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">t</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">word</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">freq</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">h</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">items</span><span class="p">():</span>
        <span class="n">t</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">extend</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="n">word</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">freq</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">random</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">choice</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The expression * freq creates a list with freq copies of the string
word. The extend method is similar to append except that the argument is
a sequence.</p>
<p>This algorithm works, but it is not very efficient; each time you choose
a random word, it rebuilds the list, which is as big as the original
book. An obvious improvement is to build the list once and then make
multiple selections, but the list is still big.</p>
<p>An alternative is:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Use keys to get a list of the words in the book.</li>
<li>Build a list that contains the cumulative sum of the word frequencies
(see Exercise&nbsp;[cumulative]). The last item in this list is the total
number of words in the book, <span class="math">n</span>.</li>
<li>Choose a random number from 1 to <span class="math">n</span>. Use a bisection search
(See Exercise&nbsp;[bisection]) to find the index where the random number
would be inserted in the cumulative sum.</li>
<li>Use the index to find the corresponding word in the word list.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Markov analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#markov-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you choose words from the book at random, you can get a sense of the
vocabulary, but you probably won’t get a sentence:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>this the small regard harriet which knightley&#39;s it most things
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A series of random words seldom makes sense because there is no
relationship between successive words. For example, in a real sentence
you would expect an article like “the” to be followed by an adjective or
a noun, and probably not a verb or adverb.</p>
<p>One way to measure these kinds of relationships is Markov analysis,
which characterizes, for a given sequence of words, the probability of
the words that might come next. For example, the song <em>Eric, the Half a
Bee</em> begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Half a bee, philosophically,</div>
<div class="line">Must, ipso facto, half not be.</div>
<div class="line">But half the bee has got to be</div>
<div class="line">Vis a vis, its entity. D’you see?</div>
<div class="line">But can a bee be said to be</div>
<div class="line">Or not to be an entire bee</div>
<div class="line">When half the bee is not a bee</div>
<div class="line">Due to some ancient injury?</div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In this text, the phrase “half the” is always followed by the word
“bee”, but the phrase “the bee” might be followed by either “has” or
“is”.</p>
<p>The result of Markov analysis is a mapping from each prefix (like “half
the” and “the bee”) to all possible suffixes (like “has” and “is”).</p>
<p>Given this mapping, you can generate a random text by starting with any
prefix and choosing at random from the possible suffixes. Next, you can
combine the end of the prefix and the new suffix to form the next
prefix, and repeat.</p>
<p>For example, if you start with the prefix “Half a”, then the next word
has to be “bee”, because the prefix only appears once in the text. The
next prefix is “a bee”, so the next suffix might be “philosophically”,
“be” or “due”.</p>
<p>In this example the length of the prefix is always two, but you can do
Markov analysis with any prefix length.</p>
<p>Markov analysis:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Write a program to read a text from a file and perform Markov
analysis. The result should be a dictionary that maps from prefixes
to a collection of possible suffixes. The collection might be a list,
tuple, or dictionary; it is up to you to make an appropriate choice.
You can test your program with prefix length two, but you should
write the program in a way that makes it easy to try other lengths.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Add a function to the previous program to generate random text based
on the Markov analysis. Here is an example from <em>Emma</em> with prefix
length 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>He was very clever, be it sweetness or be angry, ashamed or only
amused, at such a stroke. She had never thought of Hannah till
you were never meant for me?“ ”I cannot make speeches, Emma:&#8221; he
soon cut it all himself.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For this example, I left the punctuation attached to the words. The
result is almost syntactically correct, but not quite. Semantically,
it almost makes sense, but not quite.</p>
<p>What happens if you increase the prefix length? Does the random text
make more sense?</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Once your program is working, you might want to try a mash-up: if you
combine text from two or more books, the random text you generate
will blend the vocabulary and phrases from the sources in interesting
ways.</p>
</li>

<h2>Data structures<a class="headerlink" href="#data-structures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Using Markov analysis to generate random text is fun, but there is also
a point to this exercise: data structure selection. In your solution to
the previous exercises, you had to choose:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>How to represent the prefixes.</li>
<li>How to represent the collection of possible suffixes.</li>
<li>How to represent the mapping from each prefix to the collection of
possible suffixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last one is easy: a dictionary is the obvious choice for a mapping
from keys to corresponding values.</p>
<p>For the prefixes, the most obvious options are string, list of strings,
or tuple of strings.</p>
<p>For the suffixes, one option is a list; another is a histogram
(dictionary).</p>
<p>How should you choose? The first step is to think about the operations
you will need to implement for each data structure. For the prefixes, we
need to be able to remove words from the beginning and add to the end.
For example, if the current prefix is “Half a”, and the next word is
“bee”, you need to be able to form the next prefix, “a bee”.</p>
<p>Your first choice might be a list, since it is easy to add and remove
elements, but we also need to be able to use the prefixes as keys in a
dictionary, so that rules out lists. With tuples, you can’t append or
remove, but you can use the addition operator to form a new tuple:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">shift</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">prefix</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">word</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">prefix</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:]</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">word</span><span class="p">,)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>shift takes a tuple of words, prefix, and a string, word, and forms a
new tuple that has all the words in prefix except the first, and word
added to the end.</p>
<p>For the collection of suffixes, the operations we need to perform
include adding a new suffix (or increasing the frequency of an existing
one), and choosing a random suffix.</p>
<p>Adding a new suffix is equally easy for the list implementation or the
histogram. Choosing a random element from a list is easy; choosing from
a histogram is harder to do efficiently (see Exercise&nbsp;[randhist]).</p>
<p>So far we have been talking mostly about ease of implementation, but
there are other factors to consider in choosing data structures. One is
run time. Sometimes there is a theoretical reason to expect one data
structure to be faster than other; for example, I mentioned that the in
operator is faster for dictionaries than for lists, at least when the
number of elements is large.</p>
<p>But often you don’t know ahead of time which implementation will be
faster. One option is to implement both of them and see which is better.
This approach is called <strong>benchmarking</strong>. A practical alternative is to
choose the data structure that is easiest to implement, and then see if
it is fast enough for the intended application. If so, there is no need
to go on. If not, there are tools, like the profile module, that can
identify the places in a program that take the most time.</p>
<p>The other factor to consider is storage space. For example, using a
histogram for the collection of suffixes might take less space because
you only have to store each word once, no matter how many times it
appears in the text. In some cases, saving space can also make your
program run faster, and in the extreme, your program might not run at
all if you run out of memory. But for many applications, space is a
secondary consideration after run time.</p>
<p>One final thought: in this discussion, I have implied that we should use
one data structure for both analysis and generation. But since these are
separate phases, it would also be possible to use one structure for
analysis and then convert to another structure for generation. This
would be a net win if the time saved during generation exceeded the time
spent in conversion.</p>

<h2>Debugging<a class="headerlink" href="#debugging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When you are debugging a program, and especially if you are working on a
hard bug, there are five things to try:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Reading:</dt>
<dd>Examine your code, read it back to yourself, and check that it says
what you meant to say.</dd>
<dt>Running:</dt>
<dd>Experiment by making changes and running different versions. Often
if you display the right thing at the right place in the program,
the problem becomes obvious, but sometimes you have to build
scaffolding.</dd>
<dt>Ruminating:</dt>
<dd>Take some time to think! What kind of error is it: syntax, runtime,
or semantic? What information can you get from the error messages,
or from the output of the program? What kind of error could cause
the problem you’re seeing? What did you change last, before the
problem appeared?</dd>
<dt>Rubberducking:</dt>
<dd>If you explain the problem to someone else, you sometimes find the
answer before you finish asking the question. Often you don’t need
the other person; you could just talk to a rubber duck. And that’s
the origin of the well-known strategy called <strong>rubber duck
debugging</strong>. I am not making this up; see
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging</a>.</dd>
<dt>Retreating:</dt>
<dd>At some point, the best thing to do is back off, undoing recent
changes, until you get back to a program that works and that you
understand. Then you can start rebuilding.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Beginning programmers sometimes get stuck on one of these activities and
forget the others. Each activity comes with its own failure mode.</p>
<p>For example, reading your code might help if the problem is a
typographical error, but not if the problem is a conceptual
misunderstanding. If you don’t understand what your program does, you
can read it 100 times and never see the error, because the error is in
your head.</p>
<p>Running experiments can help, especially if you run small, simple tests.
But if you run experiments without thinking or reading your code, you
might fall into a pattern I call “random walk programming”, which is the
process of making random changes until the program does the right thing.
Needless to say, random walk programming can take a long time.</p>
<p>You have to take time to think. Debugging is like an experimental
science. You should have at least one hypothesis about what the problem
is. If there are two or more possibilities, try to think of a test that
would eliminate one of them.</p>
<p>But even the best debugging techniques will fail if there are too many
errors, or if the code you are trying to fix is too big and complicated.
Sometimes the best option is to retreat, simplifying the program until
you get to something that works and that you understand.</p>
<p>Beginning programmers are often reluctant to retreat because they can’t
stand to delete a line of code (even if it’s wrong). If it makes you
feel better, copy your program into another file before you start
stripping it down. Then you can copy the pieces back one at a time.</p>
<p>Finding a hard bug requires reading, running, ruminating, and sometimes
retreating. If you get stuck on one of these activities, try the others.</p>

<p>The “rank” of a word is its position in a list of words sorted by
frequency: the most common word has rank 1, the second most common has
rank 2, etc.</p>
<p>Zipf’s law describes a relationship between the ranks and frequencies of
words in natural languages (<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf's_law">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf&#8217;s_law</a>).
Specifically, it predicts that the frequency, <span class="math">f</span>, of the word
with rank <span class="math">r</span> is:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><span class="math">f = c r^{-s}</span></p>
</div><p>where <span class="math">s</span> and <span class="math">c</span> are parameters that depend on the language
and the text. If you take the logarithm of both sides of this equation,
you get:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><span class="math">\log f = \log c - s \log r</span></p>
</div><p>So if you plot log <span class="math">f</span> versus log <span class="math">r</span>, you should get a
straight line with slope <span class="math">-s</span> and intercept log <span class="math">c</span>.</p>
<p>Write a program that reads a text from a file, counts word frequencies,
and prints one line for each word, in descending order of frequency,
with log <span class="math">f</span> and log <span class="math">r</span>. Use the graphing program of your
choice to plot the results and check whether they form a straight line.
Can you estimate the value of <span class="math">s</span>?</p>

need the plotting module matplotlib. If you installed Anaconda, you
